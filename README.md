# Django_Community
Being a self-learner, it becomes very difficult to know about good resources among plenty of resources available. Also, doubt solving becomes very hectic and sometimes unanswerable. 
Asking doubts and learning among peers is always considered the best way of learning. Being a part of a community who are in the same profession or rather the same background is very beneficial.
I am going to build a website for the Django community, where everyone can be part of it and can, easily open up their doubts and queries free of cost, and also the community can have an open discussion about it.
Future Aspects:-
Having virtual chat and voice assistant for common FAQs.
 can incorporate to-Do list. 
creating more-gamified website
social-media feeds and daily updating
 more responsive website
Building an event calendar that will track all the online web dev events that will be happening and the user can easily add their selected event to their To-do List .
